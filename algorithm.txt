foreach character in input:
	binaryC <- binary representation of a character
	msb <- processMsb of this binary
	lsb <- getLsb of this binary
	
	msbPar = 'x' + msb + parityBits
	lsbPar = 'x' + lsb + parityBits
	
	print into output file 4 data bits + 3 parity bits of MSB
	print into output file 4 data bits + 3 parity bits of LSB
